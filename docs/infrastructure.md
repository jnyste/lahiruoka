# Project infrastructure

## Server

The website is hosted on a t2.micro Amazon EC2 instance located in Stockholm. Developers may only log in using their private SSH keys, not using passwords.

We have chosen Nginx as our web server.

The website is currently available at https://lahiruoka.jsbn.me. We have acquired an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt, and only accept HTTPS traffic.
